## Our Mission

The aim of FBLA Overseer is to work with FBLA chapters to streamline the organization and planning of members, meetings, and events through the use of an efficient, scalable mobile app.

The various functionalities of FBLA Overseer allow chapters to stay coordinated, keep track of important information, increase team cohesiveness, and save time on planning. 

The FBLA mission is to bring business and education together in a positive working relationship through innovative leadership and career development programs. FBLA brings its mission to life through the application of its motto: Service, Education, and Progress.
FBLA Overseer hopes to uphold this motto and allow FBLA to become more efficient through the optimization of otherwise time-consuming activities. 

## Installation Guide

Download this GitHub repository by either cloning it or pressing the "Clone or Donwload" button in the root directory in this repository. There are two ways you can run the project. React Native/Expo allows for cross-platformability, meaning you can compile your code into both Android and IOS binaries. Unfortunately, we are unable to deploy an IOS application because we do not own an Apple Developer Account. Therefore, we can only run our app on IOS in the Expo Client currently. However, we have the Android APK file if you do not have/want to install the Expo Client

### Android APK

The Android APK file is located in the /bin folder. You should download this file and transfer it to your device. There are many ways of doing this. The easiest is to connect your device to your computer via USB and dropping the apk file into a folder on your mobile device. You can then search for this file and install it locally. Another way to install the APK is to download it on your computer and email it to yourself, and downloading it on your divice.

### Expo Client: 

To run the application on Expo Client, you first need to install the Expo Client from your divice's respective app/play store. For IOS you can download the Client from [IOS Download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) and for Android you can download the Client from [Android Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US). This client allows you to run the app without actually building it for production or deploying on the app/play store. Next, go to the [project url](https://expo.io/@taylorallen0913/fbla), and scan the QR code which is displayed on the website on your phone. This should send you to the Expo Client and load the application.
