## About the Application

FBLA Overseers is a mobile application used for managing local FBLA chapters. You can learn more by reading the user manual.

## Technology Stack

To enable the capability of the application to be cross-platform, our team used a framework called [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). This technology combines the extremly powerful web development Javascript framework, [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), with features from native mobile development, to allow for the "write once run anywhere" capabilities the framework provides. Ultimately this means that you can write one app which compiles into both IOS and Android Native code without sacrificing performance.

## Key Features
